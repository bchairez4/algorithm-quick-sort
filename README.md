# algorithm-quick-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the quicksort algorithm.
The input is a std::vector of elements, of a comparative type, that acts as an array and the output is the sorted array.

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot point from the array and recursively partitions the rest of the elements and sorts them according to the pivot point value. 
This implementation always picks the last element of the array/sub-array as the pivot point value.

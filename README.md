# algorithm-quick-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the quicksort algorithm.
The input is a std::vector of elements, of a comparative type, that acts as an array and the output is the sorted array.

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot point from the array and partitions the rest of the elements by partially sorting them according to the pivot point value.
